# Contributing Guidelines

Contributions are absolutely welcome!  This tool is meant to not only
demonstrate the utility of VEX files and the usefulness of the
[vex-reader](https://github.com/vdanen/vex-reader) Python library, but also
to be functionally helpful for vulnerability assessment and diagnosis.

The best way to contribute is through pull requests, opening a GitHub issue
for an RFE or bug report, etc.  I'm only using this with Red Hat's data, so
results may vary with VEX files from other vendors.  Happy to add
contributions to support those, but that's not the primary goal of this
project.

## Note on Artificial Intelligence

I have no problem with AI-generated code, in fact much of this was
accelerated with the use of such tools.  Code should be reviewed and tests
should pass, obviously, but using AI to help is fine.
